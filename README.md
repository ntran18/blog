# An Interesting Blog App With FireBase 

Developed from the starter code provided by Dr. Toal, worked with authentication and a database. 

Improved Features:

- Read other people blog if signed in 
- Delete blogs (only your own blog)
- Go back to your homepage if you click on "Blog"
- Display profile image
- Display the author at the end of each blog 
- Instead of clicking through each blog at a time, all the blogs will be displayed at once.
